After having someone play the memory game, I saw that it worked the way it was supposed to. The game lets you click 2 cards, and if it's a match, 
they stay revealed, and if it's not a match, the flip back over. The game takes count of how many turns you take and how many matches you've made.
When all the cards have been matched, the start button allows the game to make a full reset, where the cards are flipped back over and reshuffled
and the scores and turns are set back to zero. The player enjoyed the game and thought it worked as how a memory game should work.
