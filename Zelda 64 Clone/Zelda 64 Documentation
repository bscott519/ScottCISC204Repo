Ben worked on the UI, door functions, and powerup functions, Dontae worked on the enemies, Nicolas worked on expanding the space and elements of the scene,
and Julian and Matt worked on the rest of the scripts in the project. While exploring the world, users can find many collectibles like keys to open doors,
health to regain lost health, energy, and ore. There are also enemies around the map that can reduce the player's health.
